REST API?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer and is a way how a web server should respond to requests.

REST Api's handle the server side part of a web application. That is the code running on server and provides data to heterogeneous frontend application. A great example is the google calendar API.

You can create REST Api's in any development language such as C#, Java, JavaScript and many more.

The purpose of this project is to provide a place where we can create ‘skeleton api project’ with all the necessary features in different development language.
